  "description": "<p>Zeeschuimer is a browser extension that monitors internet traffic while you are browsing a social media site, and collects data about the items you see in a platform's web interface for later systematic analysis. Its target audience is researchers who wish to systematically study content on social media platforms that resist conventional scraping or API-based data collection.</p><p>This Zenodo record serves as a static, archived version of the Zeeschuimer git repository as it is tagged for release. For the latest version of the code, visit the <a href='https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/zeeschuimer'>GitHub repository</a></p>."
